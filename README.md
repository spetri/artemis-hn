# artemis-hn

This is a side project Hacker News app built in React Native. It has support for a list of stories, threaded comments, filtering, searching, and more. Additional features include:

- Themes (Either pick from pre-selected or create your own)
- Sharing comments, posts, etc
- Lots of user settings to adjust views
- Much more

I've built this mostly for self-use since I can't stand any of the current HN apps on the iOS store (which is why I focused on iOS for this project and not Android).
